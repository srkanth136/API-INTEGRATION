##​This project involves creating a dynamic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user.​

The application comprises three main components:​

HTML Structure: The index.html file defines the layout of the application, including an input field for users to enter a city name, a button to trigger the weather data fetch, and a section to display the retrieved weather information.​

CSS Styling: The style.css file provides the visual design of the application, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly. It includes styles for the input field, button, and weather information display, making the application visually appealing and easy to use.​

JavaScript Functionality: The script.js file contains the logic for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the Fetch API. It processes the user's input, constructs the API request URL, handles the response, and updates the DOM to display the weather information dynamically.​

To use the application, users enter a city name into the input field and click the "Get Weather" button. The application then sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves the current weather data for the specified city, and displays details such as temperature, weather description, and humidity.​

This project serves as an excellent introduction to integrating third-party APIs into web applications, handling user input, and dynamically updating the user interface using JavaScript.
