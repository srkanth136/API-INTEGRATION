##This project is a web-based Weather App that dynamically fetches and displays current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple yet responsive design where users can enter a city name into an input field and click a button to retrieve weather data such as temperature, description, humidity, and location details, which are then rendered dynamically on the page. The HTML file establishes the page structure with a designated display area, while the CSS file ensures a modern, clean, and responsive interface adaptable to various devices. In JavaScript, asynchronous functions handle API requests by constructing a dynamic URL that incorporates the user-provided city and a secure API key, performing error handling for invalid entries or network issues, and updating the DOM based on the API's JSON response. Overall, the project serves not only as a practical demonstration of integrating real-time API data into a webpage but also as a foundation for further enhancements, such as extended forecasts, geolocation-based queries, or additional data integrations, showcasing the benefits of combining frontend technologies with external data sources to deliver an engaging user experience.
